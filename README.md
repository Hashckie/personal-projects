Some personal projects I worked on recently

# Quizlet Converter
A script to help me converting highlighted headlines to terms and highlighted texts to definations which made studying using Quizlet more easier

# Voice ID
A small desktop application to demonstrate that we can build an app that identify users by their voice. I tried to make the code as clean as possible but unfortunately I ended up with bugs that are hard to fix because of tkinter limitations. I'm planning to remake this app with flutter and make it more responsive and maintainable
